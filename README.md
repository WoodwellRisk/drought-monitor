This site's interface and functionality rely heavily on code developed by <a href='https://carbonplan.org/' target='_blank'>CarbonPlan</a>. Specifically, we used the <a href='https://github.com/carbonplan/maps' target='_blank'>`maps`</a>, <a href='https://github.com/carbonplan/components' target='_blank'>`components`</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/carbonplan/layouts' target='_blank'>`layouts`</a> libraries. We took inspiration from CarbonPlan's <a href="https://github.com/carbonplan/forest-risks-web" target="_blank">forest risks</a> code repository to create an updated and modified user interface for this data viewer. You can read more about CarbonPlan's research and software development work <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research" target="_blank">here</a>.
